When building your Netflix clone, there are certain pieces of code you definitely shouldn't forget to ensure your app is functional, efficient, and easy to maintain. Here's a list of critical code elements you should not miss:

1. API Integration Logic
Make sure you correctly handle API calls using Axios or another HTTP client. Your axios.js utility or similar setup should handle all interactions with the TMDB API. This includes:

Handling requests to fetch data.
Using try-catch blocks for error handling.
Ensuring that the API base URL and endpoints are properly set up.
Example:

javascript
Copy
Edit
import axios from "axios";

const instance = axios.create({
  baseURL: "https://api.themoviedb.org/3",  // Base API URL
});

export default instance;
2. useEffect for Data Fetching
In your Row component (or wherever you're displaying movie data), use useEffect to fetch data from the API when the component mounts. Ensure you handle asynchronous code properly and update the component state with the fetched data.

Example:

javascript
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  (async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get(fetchUrl);
      setMovies(response.data.results);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error fetching data", error);
    }
  })();
}, [fetchUrl]); // Re-fetch if the URL changes
3. PropTypes Validation
PropTypes help ensure that your components receive the right type of data, which makes your code more robust and maintainable. Don't forget to validate props in components that receive dynamic data (like Row).

Example:

javascript
Copy
Edit
Row.propTypes = {
  title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  fetchUrl: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  isLargeRow: PropTypes.bool,
};
4. Responsive Layout
Ensure your layout is responsive using CSS or a CSS-in-JS solution (like styled-components). Include media queries to adjust your layout for different screen sizes. This will help ensure your app looks good on both mobile and desktop devices.

Example:

css
Copy
Edit
/* Example of media queries */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .row__posters {
    padding: 10px;
  }
  .row__poster {
    max-height: 150px;
  }
}
5. CSS for Smooth Scrolling
You mentioned scroll functionality in your Row component. If you're using scrollable containers, don't forget to add smooth scrolling for better UX.

Example:

css
Copy
Edit
.row__posters {
  display: flex;
  overflow-x: scroll;
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}
6. YouTube Component Integration (if applicable)
If you're showing trailers with react-youtube or any video player, ensure you properly handle the videoId prop and manage the display of trailers. Don't forget to include a close button if needed.

Example:

javascript
Copy
Edit
{trailerUrl && (
  <YouTube
    videoId={trailerUrl}
    opts={{
      height: "390",
      width: "100%",
      playerVars: {
        autoplay: 1,
      },
    }}
  />
)}
7. Image Rendering and Caching
Since you're working with movie posters and backdrops, make sure images are loading efficiently. Use proper image sizing and lazy loading to improve performance.

Example:

javascript
Copy
Edit
<img
  key={movie.id}
  className={`row__poster ${isLargeRow && "row__posterLarge"}`}
  src={`${base_url}${isLargeRow ? movie.poster_path : movie.backdrop_path}`}
  alt={movie.name}
/>
8. State Management for Trailer URL
For functionality like displaying movie trailers, manage the state for the selected trailer URL. When a user clicks a movie, the trailer should update.

Example:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const [trailerUrl, setTrailerUrl] = useState("");

const handleClick = (movie) => {
  if (trailerUrl) {
    setTrailerUrl(""); // Close the trailer
  } else {
    // Fetch and set trailer URL (e.g., using TMDB or YouTube API)
  }
};
9. Scroll Indicators
If you're allowing users to scroll horizontally, make sure your scroll indicators (like the right caret) are functioning. Use event listeners to track the scroll position and enable/disable the indicator when necessary.

Example:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const handleScrollRight = () => {
  if (rowRef.current) {
    rowRef.current.scrollBy({ left: 300, behavior: "smooth" });
  }
};
10. Error Handling
Always make sure to include proper error handling for data fetching, especially when working with external APIs. Display meaningful error messages to the user in case something goes wrong.

Example:

javascript
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  (async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get(fetchUrl);
      setMovies(response.data.results);
    } catch (error) {
      setError("Something went wrong. Please try again later.");
    }
  })();
}, [fetchUrl]);

// Display error message
{error && <p>{error}</p>}
11. Component Cleanup
Ensure that when components unmount (for instance, when navigating away from the page), you clean up any ongoing asynchronous operations like fetching data or closing any external services (e.g., YouTube video player).

Example:

javascript
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  const controller = new AbortController();

  (async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get(fetchUrl, {
        signal: controller.signal,  // Aborts fetch if component unmounts
      });
      setMovies(response.data.results);
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.name !== "AbortError") {
        console.error(error);
      }
    }
  })();

  return () => {
    controller.abort();  // Cleanup when component unmounts
  };
}, [fetchUrl]);
Key Takeaways:
API calls and error handling should be robust and well-managed.
State management is crucial for managing dynamic data like trailers.
Responsive design and smooth scrolling should be implemented for the best user experience.
Modular code with reusable components ensures maintainability.
By focusing on these areas and ensuring the necessary code is implemented and well-structured, your project will be solid, functional, and ready to scale.
